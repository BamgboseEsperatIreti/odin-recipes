    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p> Yam porridge,also known as Asaro,is a very 
        delicious yam recipe though its eaten by most 
        tribes in Nigeria however,it is more common
    in the yoruba speaking parts of Nigeria.
    Its also easy to make.  </p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>puna yam</li> 
     <li>blended pepper</li> 
     <li>Tomatoes</li> 
     <li>Onion</li>
     <li>palm oil</li> 
     <li>seasoning</li> 

    </ul>
    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
       <li>Its best to use the freshest palm oil you can 
           possibly get because stale plam oil will
           ruin the taste of the pottage.  </li>
        <li>Its best to use as little seasoning 
            as possible because the yam itself is sweet
            so excessive seasoning will overshadow
            the sweet taste of the pottage.  </li> 
        <li>Add a little more water if necessary but 
            dont overdo it.</li>      

    </ol>
